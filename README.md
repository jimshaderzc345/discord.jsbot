This is a bot made using discord.js by me. This is a simple discord.js bot that is good for many servers. I decided to make this public to help people that are new to discord.js. Your welcome to copy commands from my code into your own bot! This code is updated daily, so make sure to come check back every day to see the updated code!

Note: at the time, hosting this bot on heroku will not work. I am working on making the bot compatible with heroku.

Make sure to run "npm install" before running "node index.js"


You will need the latest version of node and discord.js to use this bot.


Please note that the commands under custom commands are meant for a specific server (you are still welcome to use them). I provided an example of the custom command format in case you want to make your own custom commands. If you do not want the custom commands I provided (which you probably will not want them) then just delete them. If you delete them it will not affect the bot at all.
