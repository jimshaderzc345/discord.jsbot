    This is a discord.js bot made by me with my own code. I am working on this bot for fun and I decided to make it public on github to help people that are new to discord.js. I am working on making this bot with more commands. To run the bot after you make your config file, run "npm install" and then "node index.js".# discord.js-starter-bot
