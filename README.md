This is a bot made using discord.js by me. This is a simple discord.js bot that is good for many servers. I decided to make this public to help people that are new to discord.js. Your welcome to copy commands from my code into your own bot! This code is updated daily, so make sure to come check back every day to see the updated code!

Note: at the time, hosting this bot on heroku will not work. I am working on making the bot compatible with heroku.

Make sure to run "npm install" before running "node index.js"
